Hi! I'm **Yuanqiu (Zoe) Tan**, a Ph.D. student in Electrical and Computer Engineering at Purdue University, advised by Prof. Zhihong Chen.

My research focuses on `ultra-scaled transistors and spintronic devices` that aim to advance computation `beyond silicon and conventional CMOS technologies`. I am particularly interested in how novel materials and device architectures can enable CMOS integration and energy-efficient `probabilistic computing`.

Outside of research, I enjoy dancing, taking care of plants and animals, and discovering new coffee and tea experiences.

Feel free to reach out — I always enjoy connecting with people who share similar interests!
