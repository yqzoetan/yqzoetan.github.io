To give your project a background in the portfolio page, just add the img tag to the front matter like so:


<div class="row">
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.liquid loading="eager" path="assets/img/project1_1.jpg" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
</div>
<div class="caption">
    Left image reference: K. P. O’Brien et al. (2023), Nat. Commun., vol. 14, no. 1. Right image reference: Y. Tan et al. (2025) ACS Nano. 
</div>

You can also put regular text between your rows of images, even citations {% cite einstein1950meaning %}.
Say you wanted to write a bit about your project before you posted the rest of the images.
You describe how you toiled, sweated, _bled_ for your project, and then... you reveal its glory in the next row of images.

The continuous downscaling of silicon-based transistors is approaching its physical and material limits, as short-channel effects increasingly degrade device performance. To sustain progress in computing performance and integration density, three-dimensional (3D) complementary field-effect transistor (CFET) architectures have emerged as a promising solution by vertically stacking n-type and p-type transistors. This project explores two-dimensional (2D) transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs)-such as MoS₂, WS₂, and WSe₂—as next-generation channel materials for monolithic 3D integration beyond silicon. The atomically thin nature of these monolayer TMDs enables superior electrostatic control, minimal short-channel effects, and reduced parasitic coupling in ultra-scaled transistors.

Our research focuses on achieving high-performance monolayer TMD devices through atomic defect engineering and controlled doping, enabling tunable carrier polarity and enhanced mobility. We also investigate the surface and interface chemistry of 2D TMDs, including defect passivation and dielectric integration, to improve device reliability and contact performance. These efforts aim to establish a scalable materials and process platform for 3D integration compatible with both front-end and back-end transistor fabrication.

This work is supported by Intel and the Semiconductor Research Corporation (SRC), contributing to the broader goal of advancing energy-efficient, high-density computing technologies for the post-silicon era.
