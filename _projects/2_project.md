As interconnect dimensions approach the sub-20 nm regime, the thickness of conventional Cu diffusion barriers and liners (such as TaN/Ta) has become a critical bottleneck, consuming a large fraction of the metal cross-section and severely degrading conductivity. At the same time, future 3D integration and high-density interconnect technologies—both monolithic and heterogeneous—require materials that can reliably block Cu diffusion, adhere well to metals, and remain electrically conductive, all while being deposited at low temperatures compatible with BEOL processing. These challenges have motivated the search for atomically thin alternatives capable of functioning as ultra-scaled barriers and liners.

Our research focuses on leveraging two-dimensional (2D) TMD materials as next-generation interconnect materials for ultra-scaled Cu/Co wiring. Building on our prior work studying the diffusion barrier and liner performance of 2D materials such as h-BN and MoS₂, we now investigate TMD-based and graphene-based ultrathin films as promising replacements for conventional barriers. We develop BEOL-compatible PECVD processes (400–450 °C) for nanometer-thin TaSₓ, MoSₓ, and graphene layers, enabling growth on arbitrary substrates, including deep via structures relevant for advanced interconnects. These 2D layers effectively inhibit Cu diffusion, serve as high-quality liners that support Cu seeding and adhesion, and enhance the overall electrical performance of Cu/Co interconnects. Through this work, we aim to establish a scalable materials platform that addresses the fundamental scaling limitations of interconnect technology. It provides a pathway to overcome fundamental scaling bottlenecks in diffusion barrier/liner technology and supports the next generation of 3D integrated systems, including sub-micron TSVs, high-density HBM, and advanced BEOL metallization.
